# PicoCTF Writeups

Technical documentation and challenge solutions from the [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) platform. These writeups cover challenges completed during downtime between studying and parent life.

## About

PicoCTF is a beginner-friendly CTF platform created by Carnegie Mellon University's CyLab, designed to introduce students and professionals to cybersecurity fundamentals through hands-on challenges. This repository serves as both a learning log and reference material for others working through similar problems.

Each writeup includes:
- Challenge description and metadata
- Approach and reconnaissance
- Solution walkthrough with code/commands
- Tools and techniques used
- Key takeaways and lessons learned

## Structure

```
.
├── binary-exploitation/
├── cryptography/
├── forensics/
├── general-skills/
├── reverse-engineering/
└── web-exploitation/
```

Challenges are organized by category. Each writeup follows a consistent format optimized for both technical clarity and readability.

## Publishing

All writeups are published across three platforms for maximum visibility:

1. **GitHub** (source of truth) - Raw markdown with full technical detail
2. **[Medium](https://medium.com/@Aeronique)** - Formatted for immediate discoverability and SEO
3. **[aerobytes.io](https://aerobytes.io/writeups/)** - Personal archive with custom styling

Medium posts use tags: `Cybersecurity`, `CTF`, `PicoCTF`, `Infosec`, `Bug Bounty` for optimal reach.
